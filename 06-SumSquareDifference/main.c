 * Description: Problem 6 of the PojectEuler series. The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
 *                                      12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
 *              The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 *                                      (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
 *              Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the 
 *              square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of 
 *              the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
